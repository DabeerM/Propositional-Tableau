# Propositional-Tableau
This program takes a file with propositional formulae and evaluates them to see whether said formulae are True or False
(assuming of course if it is a valid formula in the first place!).
The propositional formulae can have up to 3 variables (namely p,q & r) and there are 3 operators - '^' (logical AND); 
'v' (logical OR) and '-' (logical NOT).
